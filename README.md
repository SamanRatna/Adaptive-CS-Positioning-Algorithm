# Overview

This Project implements an awesome Algorithm that helps EV Charger Suppliers to understand the route between two locations, and help make installation decisions

## Input to be fed into the System

- SoC of the EV before starting the Route
- Range of the EV
- Distance between Point A and Point B
- Threshold Minimum SoC

## Output from the System

- Number of Charging Stations
- Location Distance of the Charging Stations
- Range Anxiety at each locations
